    There are two popular 16 bit crc calculations.  The one I
    used is the crc16 used for DDCMP and Bisync communications.
    Its polynomial is: x^16 + x^15 + x^2 + 1, with an initial
    value of 0. I call it crc16().  The other common crc is used
    in ADCCP, HDLC and SDLC; its polynomial is: x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1,
    with an initial value of -1.  I call it ccitt(). If you are
    using the crc to hash you may want to play with both or invent
    your own.

/*	Computing a POLY number from the crc equation.
 *	Crc's are usually expressed as an polynomial expression such as:
 *
 *		x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1
 *
 *	Since the highest order term is to the power 16 this is a
 *	16 bit crc.  The POLY number is determined by setting bits
 *	corresponding to the power terms in the polynomial equation
 *	in an integer.  To do this we number the bits of the integer
 *	with the most significant bit = bit 0. CAUTION: this is the
 *	opposite to the some bit numbering schemes.  This is due to
 *	the least significant bit first convention of crc calculations.
 *	The above equation becomes:
 *
 *	  1   0   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0   0
 *	|___.___.___.___|___.___.___.___|___.___.___.___|___.___.___.___|
 *	  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15
 *	msb                                                          lsb
 *
 *	Note: the "1" term is equivalent to "x^0" and the "x^16"
 *	term is ignored (it does determine the length to be 16 bits).
 *	Thus the POLY number is 0x8408 (ccitt crc).
